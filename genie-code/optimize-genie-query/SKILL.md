Use inside Databricks when users ask to investigate slow, expensive, queued, spilling, full-scan, poorly pruned, high-latency, high-cost, or warehouse-constrained Genie Space benchmark queries while preserving answer correctness."

# Optimize Genie Query For Genie Code

Analyze Genie Space benchmark-generated SQL from a performance and cost lens. In Genie Code Agent mode, start from benchmark questions, launch native benchmark execution only after explicit user approval, then use Query History Insights as the primary triage signal when available. Validate every insight against Query Profile, generated SQL, table layout, SQL warehouse evidence, Unity Catalog metadata, system tables, and bounded read-only SQL output as needed.

## Hard Rules

- This skill is diagnostic and recommendation-first. It may launch native benchmark runs only after explicit user approval. Do not edit the Genie Space, benchmark definitions, SQL warehouse settings, Unity Catalog objects, source schemas, or source data.
- Use only bounded read-only SQL: `SELECT`, `WITH`, `SHOW`, `DESCRIBE`, `EXPLAIN`, `information_schema`, and system-table reads.
- Do not run `ALTER`, `OPTIMIZE`, `ANALYZE`, `VACUUM`, `CREATE`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `MERGE`, table rewrites, warehouse edits, benchmark definition edits, or Genie Space edits.
- Preserve answer correctness. If the generated SQL is semantically wrong, stop performance tuning and hand off to `diagnose-genie-space` or `optimize-genie-space`.
- Treat Query performance insights as a Private Preview feature: absent, hidden, or unavailable Insights are limitations, not evidence that performance is healthy.
- Treat cache hits, missing Query Profile access, private or encrypted system-table fields, unavailable system tables, and incomplete query history as limitations.
- Prefer concrete insight, query, profile, warehouse, and table-layout evidence over generic optimization advice.
- Use Query History's Genie Code `/analyze` or `/optimize` entry point for an insight-backed query when available, but validate the result before accepting any recommendation.
- Recommend mutating actions such as `ANALYZE`, predictive optimization, liquid clustering, `OPTIMIZE`, materialized views, source rewrites, Space edits, benchmark edits, or warehouse scaling only as user-approved follow-up work outside this skill.

## Workflow

1. Establish the performance case:
   - Space name or identifier
   - benchmark target, execution mode when relevant, and benchmark question IDs or question text
   - explicit user approval before launching a native benchmark run; otherwise use an existing completed run or visible Query History
   - SQL warehouse ID or name
   - benchmark run window or relevant Query History time window
   - latency, queue-time, cost, spill, scan, or concurrency goal
   - expected unchanged answer shape or business result
2. Launch or locate benchmark evidence:
   - if approved, run the narrowest useful native benchmark for the target questions and wait until benchmark executions appear in Query History
   - if benchmark execution is not approved, use the latest completed benchmark run or existing Query History rows
   - record benchmark run identity, time window, target questions, user, warehouse, and any incomplete or delayed query-history visibility
3. Open Query History and filter to benchmark-generated Genie queries:
   - filter by benchmark window, Space, warehouse, user, statement ID, query source, or available tags
   - prioritize rows with the Insights column populated or a lightbulb/performance insight indicator
   - capture statement ID, question, status, warehouse ID, duration breakdown, insight labels, statement preview, result cache status, scan metrics, spill, queue time, and query source
4. Use Insights as the primary triage signal when available:
   - click the Query History Genie Code `/analyze` or `/optimize` action for an insight-backed query when the UI exposes it
   - preserve the prefilled prompt context, but treat Genie Code's rewrite or recommendation as a candidate, not proof
   - group repeated benchmark queries by insight label, source object, SQL shape, warehouse, and benchmark question pattern
5. Fall back when Insights are absent or inaccessible:
   - if the Insights column is missing, preview-gated, empty, delayed, or unavailable, use `references/query-optimization-guide.md` and inspect Query History, Query Profile, table layout, Space context, and warehouse evidence manually
   - state the preview/access limitation explicitly in the report
6. Confirm correctness scope before tuning:
   - compare the generated SQL intent to the benchmark question, Space context, expected SQL/answer, and benchmark evaluation evidence when available
   - if the SQL answers the wrong business question, classify it as `semantic_wrong_sql` and hand off to a quality skill
   - if the SQL is correct but slow, continue with performance diagnosis
7. Validate the insight or candidate rewrite:
   - inspect Query Profile evidence for top operators, scans, joins, shuffles, sorts, windows, aggregates, filters, wide projections, Photon fallback, full table scans, exploding joins, poor pruning, memory, spill, and task time
   - inspect generated SQL and any `/analyze` or `/optimize` rewrite for semantic equivalence before proposing it
   - use `EXPLAIN` only for bounded candidate shape checks; do not treat it as a replacement for runtime profile evidence
8. Inspect the Space surfaces that can influence expensive SQL:
   - attached tables, views, Metric Views, materialized views, measures, dimensions, filters, and descriptions
   - hidden or exposed columns, especially wide free-text, JSON, arrays, maps, structs, blobs, embeddings, and noisy technical fields
   - joins, snippets, example SQL, SQL functions, prompt matching settings, and text instructions
   - source scope issues, overlapping tables, raw-table exposure where a prejoined view or Metric View would be more efficient, and broad examples that encourage `SELECT *`
9. Inspect table and layout evidence with bounded reads:
   - table type, row count estimates, size, partitioning, clustering keys, file layout, freshness, and whether sources are managed, external, foreign, Delta, Iceberg, views, materialized views, or Metric Views
   - predictive optimization inheritance/status, recent predictive optimization operations when accessible, and whether statistics support data skipping and the optimizer
   - commonly filtered, joined, grouped, ranked, or ordered columns from the generated SQL and Query History
10. Inspect SQL warehouse evidence:
   - warehouse type, size, max clusters, serverless/pro/classic capabilities, Photon/Predictive IO/IWM availability, startup delays, queue pressure, spill symptoms, and warehouse events
   - whether the symptom points to queue/concurrency, startup, memory pressure, scan volume, query shape, or table layout
11. Classify findings using `references/query-optimization-guide.md`. Separate:
   - Query performance insight labels and validated issue labels
   - query-shape issues
   - table-layout/statistics issues
   - warehouse capacity or concurrency issues
   - Genie Space source/scope issues
   - semantic correctness issues
   - evidence/access limitations
12. Recommend the smallest useful performance lever. Prefer reducing query work before increasing compute unless the evidence primarily shows queue pressure, startup delay, or unavoidable memory pressure.
13. Produce a concise query optimization report in chat or notebook output.
